# Project 1: Quadrants and Distance

Welcome to your first Python Project. Your assignment directions are in the "Objective.docx" file where you will see a description of what you need to do.

your first step should be to download everything from the repository onto your machine into a folder you can find easily.

## Step 1:
Read through Objective document fully to get a better understanding of what you need to do.

## Step 2:
Open a coding environment where you will load the "project1.py" contents and look at your starter code.

## Step 3:
Start the process bit by bit and follow instructions carefully.

# Everything is formatted for you. You just need to add the functionality part

# When you are finished, add all your changes to your GitHub project repository and commit the changes. Then you need to submit a link to your repository to the Schoology assignment.
